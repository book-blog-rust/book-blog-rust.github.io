I am a 20 year old Engineering student studying at Bangalore Institute Of Technology. \
Currently working as a Research Intern at Cloud Systems Lab of Indian Institute of Science. \
Freelance Data Scientist at MI4People. 
I am passionate about all things nerdy. My main interests are in the domain of AI/ML but now that I'm working with Computer System Softwares; Deployment and Development in general, catching a taste for these skills as well. Stepped into the domain of Web3 through ETHIndia Hackathon, and I am awestricken by the community of Web3. I am a contributing member of Crunch DAO (a blissful merge of Data Science and Web3). 
 **flex alert** I use a RTX 3060 laptop (yeah bought it for Deep Learning stuff xD) so am very much interested to know the 0s and 1s of GPU architecture and programming, to explore the most computationally powerful machines of our time. I feel creative writing blogs and explaining the concpts I know.  

### Purpose of the book
